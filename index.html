          <p>Even as a recent graduate, Marcella has done everything from lobbying for a universal health care firm, to software engineering, to interning at a hedge fund. Nothing has added fuel to her fire like incubating Anthill and creating a solution to an issue that negatievly affects every human: unemployment.  Anthill has brought her through a two business plan competitions, to Las Vegas as Thiel Foundation Summiteer, and onto a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NzNs8FAudQ">TEDx</a> stage where she discussed her philosophy behind entrepreneurship in a talk titled "Passion, Programming, and Pragmatism." </p>

Now, he loves building software that solves huge problems.</p>
          <p>When not telling computers what to do he can be found hiking up mountains during the summer or sliding down them with a snowboard strapped to his feet during the winter.</p>

        <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p>The philosophy behind the movement: Hard working ants in a concentrated area build magnificent, strong, and intricate little cities. Ants have a division of labor, communication between individuals, an ability to solve complex problems.</p>
        <p><span class="primary-text">Most importantly, they live and work together.</span></p>
        <p>Their ecosystems are emblematic of cities.  Anthills represent a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. Ants are sharers, creators, builders, communicators, and laborers. So are we, and we are ready to work.</p>
